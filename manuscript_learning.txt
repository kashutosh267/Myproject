In the earlier commit you changed 10 files. So the commit would show 10 files and their differences. But in amend you had to change 
1 out of the above 10 files changed previously. So my question was how is difference caculated now with the previous version.

During amend : 9 files remained the same and 1 changed. So the difference of 9 files remained the same as it was previously.
And the difference of 1 modified file is caculated again.

1  2  3

Initially commit 1 m 10 files changed : difference 2 - 1
Amend .. 1 out of above 10 files : Version 1 would be deleted when we commit.
My doubt was how is difference calculated then. 

To unstage a staged file, the command git restore -- <filename> staged (to unstage) and git restore <filename> (to discard changes which 
is overwriting with the last commited version of the file>
A similar command could exist to bring back one version of the file of an older as well.(?)

ssh url doesn't require credentials whereas http url requires credentials.

Adding remote : Remote to a particular repository to any other repository (central or any other user) could be made. This basically helps you to create a alias to a large and complicated url so that you can pull and do other functionalities which involve url very easily.
